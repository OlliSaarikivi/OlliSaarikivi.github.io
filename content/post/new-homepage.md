This is my new homepage, which I've set up to have some web presence aside from Facebook. This will be a place to find my up-to-date CV as well as info on any personal projects I may be working on (as soon as I get around to writing about them).

The website itself is generated with the static site generator [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/). The theme is a heavily modified version of the [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) theme. Any comments about the website are welcome.
