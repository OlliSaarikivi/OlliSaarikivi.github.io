# Education

## Doctoral student
**Sept. 2013 – present** Aalto University, Department Computer Science and Engineering

My thesis working title is “Automated testing methods for concurrent
software”.

## M.Sc. in Computer Science
**Sept. 2011 – Aug. 2013** Aalto University, Department of Information and Computer Science

The thesis title was “Test-Guided Proofs for C Programs on LLVM”. My
instructors were Prof. Keijo Heljanko and Kari Kähkönen M.Sc. (Tech.).

## B.Sc. in Computer Science
**Sept. 2007 – Apr. 2011** Helsinki University, Department of Computer Science

## Päivölä High School of Mathematics
**July 2004 – May 2006**

During this I had the opportunity to work at Nokia Research Center,
thanks to a partnership between Nokia and the school. See the Work
Experience section for details.

# Work Experience

## Aalto University
**1 Sept. 2013 – present** Doctoral student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering

See the Education section for details.

**1 June 2010 – 31 Aug. 2013** Research assistant at the Department of Information and Computer Science

I worked on projects researching automated software testing
and verification. I extended the dynamic symbolic execution tool LCT to
support testing multithreaded Java programs. I also implemented a
dynamic partial order reduction algorithm and we published the
improvements I made in the paper “Improving Dynamic Partial Order
Reductions for Concolic Testing”. For my Master’s Thesis I implemented
the Dash algorithm for testing C programs.

From the summer of 2012 onwards I was employed full time. During previous
teaching periods I was employed part time, 1 day per week, while
the summers were full time.

## Helsinki University of Technology
**1 June 2009 – 31 Aug. 2009** Research assistant at the Laboratory for Theoretical
Computer Science

I worked on a project researching formal methods and automated testing.
I developed a set of utilities to generate test drivers for the
automated testing tool LCT and unit tests from the output of the testing
tool. I also designed and implemented a heuristic for directed testing.

## Optofidelity Ltd.

**17 June 2008 – 29 June 2008** 36 hours of work on a one-off project.

I built a sound capture component for a visual programming environment.

**5 June 2007 – 24 Aug. 2007** Trainee

My main project was a technology demo that used a PTZ camera and a
machine vision library to track a printed target and read a handwritten
phone number from it.

## Nokia Research Center

**26 June 2006 – 28 July 2006** Full time trainee  
**12 Aug. 2005 – 31 May 2006** Part time trainee, 12 hours/week  
**1 June 2005 – 11 Aug. 2005** Full time trainee  
**1 Sept. 2004 – 31 May 2005** Part time trainee, 12 hours/week  

The work was software development for internal projects. Two of my
projects were concept demos on using image analysis techniques to
generate content in games. One project was a technology demo for a
mobile multiplayer gaming framework.

This traineeship was part of my education at the Päivölä High School of
Mathematics.

# Conferences and Schools

Attended the 25th Nordic Workshop on Programming Theory (NWPT 2013) and
gave a talk titled *LCT-D: Test-Guided Proofs for C Programs on LLVM*.

Attended Summer School Marktoberdorf 2013 (MOD 2013) on software systems
safety.

Attended the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated
Software Engineering (ASE 2012).

Attended the 12th International Conference on Application of Concurrency
to System Design (ACSD 2012) to present the paper *Improving Dynamic
Partial Order Reductions for Concolic Testing*.

# Awards and Honours

I was selected to the **Honours Programme in Information and Computer
Science** at Aalto University for the academic years 2011–2012 and
2012–2013.
